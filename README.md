# personalRedditClient
!Disclaimer! This is a personal project that can be disregarded entirely but also can be looked at and improved at your own will.

The idea behind this redditclient, is to create a client that has functionality that the normal one lacks, as of the writing of this readme, it has almost no functionality but the idea is that it will be added during the course of who knows how many years.
